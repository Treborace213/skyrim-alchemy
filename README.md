## About

Skyrim Alchemy is a tool designed to make your potion-brewing experience in Skyrim simpler. Whether you're crafting a specific effect or trying to make the most valuable potion possible, this tool aims to make the process faster and easier.

The app is designed mobile-first but works well on desktop too. A dedicated desktop layout is planned for future updates.
